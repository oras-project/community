# ORAS Release Process

The following document outlines the ORAS project release process.

## The ORAS Project

The ORAS project consists of several repositories known as sub-projects that
enable community cohorts to experiment and implement solutions across the scope
of the project.

## Release Managers

The release managers group members are granted a set of permissions which enable
them to perform a set of release operations for the project or sub project.
The release managers MUST coordinate with the project or sub project MAINTAINERS
as per the COMMUNITY and GOVERNANCE guidelines to provide a release as per the
projects release criteria. The following MAY be the set of operations that the
release managers MAY perform.

1. Publish artifacts which include binaries, libraries, containers, release
notes, or other artifacts as per project requirements.
2. Configure CI/CD workflows and update repositories so as to facilitate the
release of the project which ‘MAY’ produce the artifacts mentioned above.

## Onboarding or change of Release Managers

The onboarding of a new release manager or change of an existing manager
for the project SHOULD be in accordance with the governance model similar
to that of an [owner] or a [sub project owner](sub-project-owner) depending on the scope of the release
activities being performed.
