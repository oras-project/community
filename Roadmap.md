# ORAS Roadmap

The ORAS project roadmap is maintained with individual subproject milestones.
We welcome proposals and feature requests from the community.

## Subproject Roadmaps

Each ORAS subproject maintains its own roadmap through GitHub milestones and issues:

## Description

An issue can be planned for a specific release when a contributor volunteers to take ownership. The owner ensures the feature is worked on and completed by the release date.

## Community Meetings

Roadmap priorities and direction are iteratively refined during regular community meetings, which are open to all community members. Contributors can propose and discuss new features, bugs, and release timeline adjustments.

## Proposing a Feature

New features can be proposed by opening an issue in the relevant subproject repository. The issue should describe:
- The feature and its use cases
- Targeted components or subprojects
- Proposed release or milestone (if applicable)

New issues are evaluated during triaging and assigned to milestones based on priority and available resources.

A [proposal for the feature](https://github.com/oras-project/oras/tree/main/docs/proposals) may need to be written for a complex feature request.

## Issue Triaging

Issues are reviewed by subproject maintainers and discussed during community meetings. Accepted issues targeting a specific release are assigned to relevant milestones.

Issues that become inactive or stale may be re-prioritized or moved to the backlog.

## Ownership of the Roadmap

Roadmap maintenance is performed by the [ORAS Org Owners](./OWNERS.md) in collaboration with subproject maintainers. Each subproject owner is responsible for maintaining their specific roadmap and milestones.
